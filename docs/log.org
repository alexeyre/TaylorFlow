#+title: Log

* Week 1
- Set up basic classes
  - ~Model~ representing a TaylorModel $(p, I)$
  - ~Interval~ representing an interval
  - ~Polynomial~ representing a polynomial
- Implemented addition and multiplication for
  - Intervals and literals
  - Intervals and intervals
  - Polynomials and literals
  - Polynomials and polynomials
  - Models and Models
  - Models and literals
- Decided on notation for in-place vs copying operations, ~x * 3.0~ does a copy
  operation by default, ~x *= 3.0~ does in-place.
* Week 2
- Converted ~Polynomial~ to use ~Interval~ classes as coefficients
- Added ~integrate~ and ~integrate_inplace~ functions to ~Polynomial~
* Week 3
- Implemented toy Picard iteration example
- Started thinking about optimisation
- Added compose function and utilities to Polynomial
- Implement test bench using Catch2
